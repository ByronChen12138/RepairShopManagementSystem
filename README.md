# Repairshop Management System for android
## ECSE 321 Project Group 11

Welcome to the ECSE 321 Group 11 project.


***

## Before Running

If you have run the persistence layer test, you must create a RepairShopManagementSystem entity in the database first before using the website. 
You can create such entity via Postman.

Furthermore, the database for the backend service in "application.properties" is in heroku. You can change it local. The 
backend URL for the frontend inside "configuration.js" can be switched local if you are running the spring on your PC.
